## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. Changes from previous version: 

* Function names are written with parentheses (such as daily_response()).
* The same suggestion was used in readme files, so all functions are now written with parentheses.
* Tests, R CMD check and downstream dependences were run once again. No error occurred. 

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.0
* Ubuntu precise (12.04.5 LTS) (on travis-ci), R version 3.4.0 (2017-04-21)
* win-builder (R Under development (unstable) (2017-07-12 r72910))

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs


## Downstream dependencies
We have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of dendroExtra
https://github.com/jernejjevsenak/dendroExtra/blob/master/revdep/checks.rds

All packages that we could install passed.
